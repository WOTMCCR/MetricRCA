| 影响范围 | tool execution, metadata service, contribution evidence |

### 背景与场景

GPT Pro review found three P2 boundary leaks: tool modules let repository execution failures escape as raw exceptions, metadata-only methods were blocked by eager LLM planner construction, and `calculate_contribution` emitted GMV UV/PAY_CVR/AOV decomposition for non-GMV metrics.

### 决策

Add a shared `metric_rca.agent.tools.runtime` helper for run/evidence validation, guarded plan execution, evidence row construction, query source summaries, and typed tool error mapping. Keep `MetricService` metadata methods independent from LLM provider availability by constructing `LLMIntentPlanner` lazily inside `parse_question()`. Restrict GMV factor decomposition to `metric_id="gmv"`; non-GMV contribution evidence reports the current metric's dimension delta summary instead of GMV-only factors.

### 理由

The future P3 graph needs tool failures as structured Observations so trace/error nodes can persist typed error codes. Metadata contracts in docs §13 are DB-backed and should be callable without OpenAI credentials. GMV decomposition is a metric-specific model; reusing it for pay conversion, refund rate, or net GMV creates misleading E4 evidence.

### 被否决的方案

Wrapping tools in a graph-level exception catcher was rejected because P2 tools must already satisfy their typed contract. Creating a no-op or fake planner for metadata access was rejected as fallback-like behavior. Returning GMV factors for all metrics with a label change was rejected because the queried factors would still be unrelated to the requested metric.

### 后续跟进

P3 should make `execute_tool` persist typed tool Observations into `trace_step` and `agent_run.error_code`. P5 should replace the current eval placeholder with a real runner and scorer over `anomaly_ground_truth`.

## ADL-0002: Intent Planner Uses LangChain OpenAI Wrapper Before Full LangGraph

| 日期 | 2026-06-09 |
| 状态 | accepted |
| 关联迭代 | fix-001-metadata-hardcode |
| 影响范围 | intent parsing, LLM provider dependency, future LangGraph integration |

### 背景与场景

The project will later implement a real LangGraph `StateGraph` for the complete RCA workflow. The current iteration only needs the intent parsing LLM call, but hand-written OpenAI HTTP request and response parsing added unnecessary local protocol code.

### 决策

Keep `LLMIntentPlanner` as the domain service boundary and implement its OpenAI call through `langchain_openai.ChatOpenAI.with_structured_output(..., method="json_schema")`. Do not introduce a one-node LangGraph graph for this P2 iteration. Add `httpx[socks]` because this environment routes external API calls through a SOCKS proxy.

### 理由

LangGraph should own multi-step RCA state orchestration, routing, reducers, repair loops, and termination policy. A single `START -> parse_question -> END` graph would not satisfy the documented P3 graph contract and would add ceremony without orchestration value. LangChain's model wrapper removes hand-written OpenAI response traversal while keeping the planner directly reusable inside a future LangGraph node.

### 被否决的方案

Keeping the raw `urllib` Responses API call was rejected as unnecessary client plumbing. Introducing LangGraph only around intent parsing was rejected because it would look like graph adoption without the real P3 RCA graph behavior.

### 后续跟进

When P3 lands, implement `agent/graph.py` with a real `StateGraph(RCAState)` and make the parse node call `MetricService.parse_question(...)` instead of duplicating model client logic in the graph node.

## ADL-0001: Metadata Contracts Move Behind Repository And Planner Boundaries

| 字段 | 值 |
|------|------|
| 日期 | 2026-06-09 |
| 状态 | accepted |
| 关联迭代 | fix-001-metadata-hardcode |
| 影响范围 | metric metadata, metric service, intent parsing, tool dependency injection |

### 背景与场景

`metric_service.py` duplicated metric definitions, schema context, and seeded dimension values as runtime constants. The same module also parsed questions with keyword branches, which conflicted with the DB-backed metadata and LLM-assisted intent parsing contracts.

### 决策

Metric metadata reads go through `MetadataRepository`, while `MetricService` caches supported metrics and dimensions at construction and delegates natural-language parsing to a configured live `LLMIntentPlanner`. Tool modules receive `metric_service` explicitly instead of importing free metadata functions.

### 理由

This preserves the documented boundary: metadata is persisted and DB-backed, parse intent does not access DB at call time, and parser tests exercise the real OpenAI intent planner instead of a mock planner. Adding a metric to `metric_definition` becomes visible to the parser context without changing runtime service constants.

### 被否决的方案

Keeping keyword parsing as a fallback was rejected because it would silently bypass the required LLM planner. Keeping service-level metadata constants was rejected because persisted metadata mutations would not affect runtime behavior.

### 后续跟进

Future graph/node work must construct `MetricService` with a real `MetadataRepository` and configured LLM provider settings.
